The workshop will highlight different tools and strategies, and will include group discussions, and the development of a shared resource for future reference. Hopefully this workshop will generate new ideas and workflows for the community to use!\nWe will have interactive polls and Q&A, but will not be coding. You can use a laptop or a smartphone to interact with the polls."

No prior accessibility experience required. Learn basic inclusive design practices, practical implementation techniques, and be inspired to put accessibility first when designing applications!\nThis workshop is aimed at absolute beginners when it comes to accessible design; the content is very introductory and will centre “first steps” and the idea of web accessibility as a constant work in progress.\nWe will have interactive polls and Q&A, but will not be coding. You can use a laptop or a smartphone to interact with the polls."
