    "text": "Abstract\nThis workshop teaches sustainable open-source dashboard development using free tools with a focus on long-term archival strategies. Participants learn about accessible, maintainable dashboards that survive project funding cycles through proper documentation, containerisation, and community-driven maintenance approaches, ensuring content remains available beyond initial development periods."

The workshop will highlight different tools and strategies, and will include group discussions, and the development of a shared resource for future reference. Hopefully this workshop will generate new ideas and workflows for the community to use!\nWe will have interactive polls and Q&A, but will not be coding. You can use a laptop or a smartphone to interact with the polls."

However, in the absence of another session being proposed on web accessibility, we would be delighted to deliver this session."
